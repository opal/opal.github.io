We have released Opal v1.3.0 a week ago and today we are releasing Opal v1.3.1 containing a few last minute fixes. We plan Opal v1.3 to be supported with a best-effort principle for a longer term, backporting bugfixes.

This is quite a big release and it's mostly focused on developer tools and error reporting improvements.

Unfortunately, due to lost interest, we didn't integrate the Webpack support as planned. But - Jan Biedermann of the Isomorfeus project contributed some preliminary ES Module support for use with ESBuild (which also seems to become a focus for Rails 7). If you don't use Isomorfeus, you can still benefit from this work (by getting some autoload support for instance) - and Isomorfeus doesn't need a patched Opal anymore!

We are planning to work on a proper `import` and npm package support for the next release, along with Ruby 3.1 support.

## Newly supported language features

We already support a lot of Ruby 3.0 features. This release fills a few missing gaps, most of which will only be used in very niche usecases.

### Refinements

Refinements are now mostly supported. If you don't like monkey patching, this feature can improve your codebase.

### Binding

Binding allows you to take a peek at local variables in a given scope. You probably most likely know it for `binding.irb` or `binding.pry` - while we don't support those yet, it's now only a matter of time when it gets implemented - all prerequisites are there already.

### Autoload

Autoload statements will cause a file to be included inside your Opal bundle, but won't load it instantly. We moved a bigger deal of corelib to benefit from faster load times.

This support can also be used to load files dynamically, like opal-zeitwerk does in Isomorfeus.

### retry

Due to an asynchronous nature of Opal, it probably won't have much use here. But still, you can now use this statement to restart the code in a rescue clause.

### super improvements

The following code used to call a super function with `(a,b,c)` arguments, now it correctly calls it with `(4,b,c)`. Also a few more edge cases were corrected.

```ruby
def method(a,b,c)
  a = 4
  super
end
```

### stdin and gets support

We have now a larger synchronous IO support. `gets` is implemented on a browser via `prompt` (aka an annoying alert popup with a text field), on other platforms, including headless chrome, it bridges stdin properly.

Reminder: for basic support of other platforms than browser, you need to `require "opal/platform"`. For extended support of NodeJS, you need to `require "nodejs"`.

```
[user@localhost opal]# opal -ropal/platform -e 'p gets' 
123 
"123\n" 
[user@localhost opal]#  
```

_Implementing `gets` is all that's needed to make a runner able to be ran in the REPL mode_

### Global variable aliases

Certainly a lesser known feature of Ruby. Did you know it's possible to write this:

```ruby
alias $PROGRAM_NAME $0
$PROGRAM_NAME = "abc" # This changes $0 as well!
```

Opal has you covered.

### Flip-flop

This Perl-inspired feature was almost removed in Ruby 3.0. But due to some interest, it was actually fixed. Opal now supports this as well! Have you never heard of this feature? That's fair enough, it mostly isn't present in production code, but can be used for writing unreadable code like this:

```ruby
a=b=c=(1..100).each do |num|
  print num, ?\r,
    ("Fizz" unless (a = !a) .. (a = !a)), 
    ("Buzz" unless (b = !b) ... !((c = !c) .. (c = !c))),
    ?\n
end
```

## Toolkit improvements

### opal-repl

The `opal-repl` command line tool gained a number of improvements:

* Windows support
* Colored output
* Support for printing native JS Objects / null / undefined
* Pry-like `ls` support
* Support for everything that opal command line tool supports
* Support for multiple runners: nodejs, chrome, gjs, quickjs, miniracer (used to be miniracer only)

```

```

### New runners

Runners are how you can use different environments to run Opal code on, using our `opal` command line tool. We added support for 3 new runners:

* gjs - the GNOME JavaScript engine based on Gecko's JS engine
* quickjs - an independently developed JavaScript engine with a good embedding support: https://bellard.org/quickjs/
* miniracer - Ruby bindings to pure V8 (used to be supported only for repl)

```
[user@localhost opal]# opal -ropal/platform -Rchrome -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM' 
"headless-chrome" 
[user@localhost opal]# opal -ropal/platform -Rnodejs -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM' 
"nodejs" 
[user@localhost opal]# opal -ropal/platform -Rgjs -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM' 
"gjs" 
[user@localhost opal]# opal -ropal/platform -Rquickjs -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM' 
"quickjs" 
[user@localhost opal]# opal -ropal/platform -Rminiracer -e 'p OPAL_PLATFORM' 
"opal-miniracer" 
[user@localhost opal]#  
```

While the support for those is preliminary and works only with stdio, there is a possibility to extend those implementations when needed (patches welcome!). GJS is now one of the primary GNOME development platforms, powering software like Flatseal, allowing you to bridge all GNOME libraries, like Glib or GTK4 (making it a fully featured Node.js alternative, though much more low level and a lot less popular - but that's a digression).

### Source map debugger

We have improved the source map support in this release. It should now much more accurately tell you which line/column is being executed. Which means - easier debugging! And that's not all, if source mapping goes wrong, you can always use our new source map debugging tool:

```
[user@localhost opal]# opal --debug-source-map -e '[1,2,3,4].each { |i| p i }' 
https://sokra.github.io/source-map-visualization/#base64,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,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,WzEsMiwzLDRdLmVhY2ggeyB8aXwgcCBpIH0=

```

This utility can be also used to help you understand which Ruby code corresponds to which JavaScript output, for educational purposes.

### Cache for `Opal::Builder`

_Sprockets doesn't use `Opal::Builder` - it has its own cache, though it may need to be configured._

Upgrade to Opal 1.3 and forget the long compilation times when using `opal` command line tool or `Opal::Builder` thru any other means (like `Opal::SimpleServer`). This is implemented by caching the marshaled Compiler objects.

```
[user@localhost opal]# time opal _1.2.0_ -e 'p 123' 
123 
 
real    0m2.321s 
user    0m2.213s 
sys    0m0.107s 
[user@localhost opal]# time opal _1.3.0_ -e 'p 123' 
123 
 
real    0m0.537s 
user    0m0.450s 
sys    0m0.090s 
[user@localhost opal]# time opal _1.2.0_ -ropal-parser -e 'p eval("(0..1)")'
Object freezing is not supported by Opal
0..1

real    0m12.555s
user    0m12.250s
sys    0m0.349s
[user@localhost opal]# time opal _1.3.0_ -ropal-parser -e 'p eval("(0..1)")'

0..1

real    0m1.512s
user    0m1.405s
sys    0m0.249s
[user@localhost opal]# 
```

## Async/await support

This big feature is experimental, may totally change in future releases of Opal, but not in the stable post-releases in the Opal 1.3 branch, and there will be a few of them! We are leaving this as experimental, because, as an Opal specific feature, it's not really compatible with Ruby itself and we hope some (unlikely) breakthrough happens.

This complements the `PromiseV2` feature implemented in Opal 1.2 - now we can await `PromiseV2`s (aka - JavaScript native promises) returned by JavaScript APIs!

```ruby
# await: sleep
require "await"

puts "Let's wait 2 seconds..."
sleep 2
puts "Done!"
```

Please consult documentation of this feature: https://opalrb.com/docs/guides/v1.3.0/async

## Conclusion

Are you starting to make a new web application and don't want to be forced to write JavaScript on the frontend? If you are adventurous, why not try Opal? You may be surprised how ready it is for your usecase :D
