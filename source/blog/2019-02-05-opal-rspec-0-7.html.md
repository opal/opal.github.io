It's been a deep work of refactoring and rewriting, adding specs and updating dependencies. Huge kudos to [@wied03](https://github.com/wied03) for the foundational work and as usual to [@iliabylich](https://github.com/iliabylich) for the laser sharp refactoring.

*For a full list of changes and updated instructions please checkout the [Changelog](https://github.com/opal/opal-rspec/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#071---2019-02-04) and the [Readme](https://github.com/opal/opal-rspec#readme).*

### New `opal-rspec` command

A new CLI executable has been added with basic functionality to aid writing and running specs. Type `opal-rspec -h` for the complete list of options.

One notable addition is the `--init` option that will help you initialize your project with opal-rspec.

### New folder defaults 📂

With this update I'm also announcing the new standard paths for opal `lib/` and `spec/` folders, which are `lib-opal/` and `spec-opal`. This will avoid the confusion about the role of the two folders and make them nicely stay near they're MRI counterparts in your editor.

In this spirit the `opal-rspec` command and all rake tasks will look for spec files in `spec-opal/`.

**Note:** those defaults are intended as the current best practice to organize an Opal project.

_🗓 More than a year has passed since the last post, if you missed Opal, that's because most of the news circulated on the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/opal/opal), that's my fault! **But rejoyce! new posts are coming and the 1.0 release is around the corner**_ 😄
